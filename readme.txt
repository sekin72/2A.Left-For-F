--- Project Description ---

Name of the Project: Left For F

Description:

Left 4 F is a turn based RPG game where you try to graduate from Bilkent CS department. Throughout your journey you encounter many homeworks,assignments, projects and proffessors. Your goal is to defeat them with your knowledge and graduate without getting F's.

You, as a student, obtain some skills which will represented by weapons. Also you will learn concepts which you can use as a enhancement to your weapons. There will be known enemies such as projects and random enemies like homeworks or quizes. There will also be enemy bosses as teachers. If player as a student could not beat the enemies which represent their school requirements as in real life he/she will get an F and fail.

The game will have a turn based combat system just like in Final Fantasy. The random enemies will pop while walking in the map like walking in tall grass in Pokemon. There won’t be any safe zones in game since in Bilkent there are no safe times for a student for not to worry about lectures. The player will have health points which can be refilled by coffees. There will be abilities for each weapon and enchantment that will be used to attack enemies. The enemies will have resistances and weaknesses if player hits an enemy with certain resistance by the same type of ability the enemy will receive less damage than it would receive normally or if player hits enemy with certain weakness by the same type of ability the enemy will receive more damage that it would receive normally. There won’t be any checkpoints like in hardcore RPG games since also in Bilkent if you get a F grade you have to do all the completed tasks again. Also you can not save and continue the game as in real life.

Requirements: The project will be written on C# using Visual Studio. It will be a Winform application and MonoGame Library will be used. The relation between the weapons and enemies, being weak or superior to one another, will be unique and challenging. The project will be completed before May 7, 2018.
